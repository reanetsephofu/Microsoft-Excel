# Global Data Science Salary Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to explore global salary trends across various data science and analytics roles using a dataset of worldwide job postings. The analysis was conducted entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, where the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualised through an interactive dashboard.  
The project was completed as part of a **data analyst portfolio** to demonstrate practical Excel skills and the ability to derive insights from large datasets, courtesy of [Luke Barousse's Excel Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/excel).

## Business Problem
Organizations and professionals in the data industry often seek to understand how compensation varies by role and location. However, raw job posting data is typically inconsistent and difficult to interpret without proper transformation and analysis.

This project addresses said challenge by converting raw job market data into a clear, visual comparison of salary trends by country and role.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project were to:
- Clean and structure raw job posting data  
- Analyse salary patterns across countries and data-related roles  
- Present insights in a dashboard that supports comparative analysis and decision-making  

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains global job postings for data-related roles, including:
- Job titles (e.g. Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer)
- Country or job location
- Salary information

## Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Data cleaning and standardisation  
  - Data transformation and aggregation  
  - Pivot tables and calculated fields  
  - Charts and interactive dashboard design  

## Key Business Questions
The analysis focused on answering the following questions:
- Which countries offer the highest average salaries for data science and analytics roles?
- How do salaries differ by job title across countries?
- Which roles tend to be the highest paying globally?
- Are there countries that consistently rank among the top-paying markets for data professionals?

## Key Findings
- **The United States and Switzerland** consistently appear among the highest-paying countries for data science roles across the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Engineer** positions command the highest average salaries in most countries, followed closely by **Data Scientist** roles.
- **Data Analyst** roles generally earn less than more specialized positions, but salaries vary significantly by country, with noticeable gaps between regions.
- Countries in **North America and Western Europe** dominate the upper salary ranges, while emerging markets show lower average pay but a growing number of job postings.
- The analysis highlights that **job title specialisation has a stronger impact on salary than location alone**, especially for advanced roles.

## Dashboard Insights
The Excel dashboard enables users to:
- Compare average salaries by country
- Filter and analyze salaries by specific data science roles
- Quickly identify top-paying roles and regions

## Analytical Value
From a data analyst perspective, this project demonstrates:
- End-to-end data analysis using Excel, from raw data to insights
- Strong ability to summarise complex datasets into clear findings
- Effective use of dashboards to support exploratory and comparative analysis

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional variables such as experience level, seniority, or employment type
- Extend the analysis using SQL or Power BI for larger datasets
- Perform trend analysis if historical salary data becomes available
